Version 0.1 - Released 2/27/2016

This is the first version of the PowerShell CM Console! Features:

Features Added:
    UI Controls
    Connect to CM Server - Requires PS Remoting! This will allow you to connect to a CM Server that isn't even on your own domain
    Boundaries - Shows you the boundaries, just like in the console! (Yeah, not that cool yet)
    Boundary Analyzer - Shows you devices that aren't in a boundary

To Do:
    Boundary Analyzer: Allow you to scope by collection / boundary / boundary group
    Discovery Methods: Enable this feature
    Save State: Cache the current state of your environment to look back on later - Will be great for detecting what changed in specific areas!
